# credit-bill-service-frintend

This system is a main requirement of a shop. In Sri Lanka there are many shops that give credit service for their products. Such as printing shops, supermarkets, Tailer shops etc. People request to pay later and traditionally sellers write the details and prices of the customer in a book called “Naya Potha”. Most of the time customers and sellers forgot actual payments and current payable amounts because sometimes sellers have to face on rush time and forget to write on the book. And sometimes customers try to fight with sellers with telling false details. This would be a solution who that want to manage proper logs about payments and credit payments in day to day selling in a shop. This is the frontend of credit bill service application.
